# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  country_e: "Self explanatory. Determined by the country code of the phone number used."
  no_meetings_created_e: "Special case: 'No meetigns created' is used mostly to display views of those users who never used the app beyond simply opening it."
  views_e: "The amount of unique users who visited the application during this time. Users are recognized via cookies."
  created_e: "The amount of meetings created."
  timers_stopped_e: "The amount of meetings that ended without an alert of any type being sent."
  messages_sent_e: "The total amount of alerts of any type sent. Essentially, a sum of direct and timer triggered alerts."
  alerts_sent_e: "The amount of alerts sent directly by pressing the 'Send alert!' button."
  notifications_sent_e: "The amount of alerts triggered by the timer."
  messages_resent_e: "If a message hasn't been delivered after five minutes, it is sent again. This is the number of such re-attempts."
  resent_messages_delivered_e: "The amount of message resends that were successfully delivered. Useful for figuring out if sending problematic messages twice actually helps."
  location_percentage_e: "Messages with location data / The total amount of messages, in a percentage format."

  text_magic_status_e: "The following statuses correspond to status codes TextMagic uses to track the status of its messages. The values are the percentage of the messages that TextMagic reports to have ended up with this particular status. Only the statuses we have seen at least once will be shown in the table above."
  q_e: "We sent the message to TextMagic, but TextMagic hasn't sent it to the mobile operator yet."
  r_e: "TextMagic sent it to the operator, but it hasn't been delivered yet. For test messages (9991231234) this can be treated as a successful delivery. For some reason, test message statuses update very slowly."
  a_e: "TextMagic sent it to the operator, but it hasn't been delivered yet."
  b_e: "TextMagic sent it to the operator, but it hasn't been delivered yet."
  d_e: "Success! The message has been delivered! This is what we hope will happen."

  e_e: "Something went horribly wrong and the message will never be delivered."
  j_e: "The mobile operator didn't like the message for some reason. Again, it will never arrive at its destination."
  u_e: "We have no idea what happened to this message. Most likely because we haven't checked yet - the status of a message is updated exactly once, five minutes after it is sent."
  s_e: "TextMagic wants to send this message later. I'm 87% certain this has to do with functionality we do not use."
